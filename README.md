## Install

Just run "npm install" to retrieve the "csvtojson" dependency. That's it
* npm install

You also need NodeJS installed. You can always use homebrew (brew) to install it on Mac. 

* brew install node

## Run

You just need to specify URL and CSVFILE using environment variables. So you can either set them or use it as a one line command like:

URL="https://www.google.be/some/path" CSVFILE="./some-cloudlets-exported-file.csv" node index.js
